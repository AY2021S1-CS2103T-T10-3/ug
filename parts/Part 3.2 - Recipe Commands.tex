\subsubsection{Viewing Recipes â€” \texttt{\bld{view} recipe}}

	This command opens the detailed view for the given recipe, allowing you to see its steps, ingredients, and tags.

	\bld{Usage:} \begin{blockofcode}{text}
		view recipe |\itemref{}|
	\end{blockofcode}

	Examples:
	\begin{bulletlist}
		& \mono{view recipe \#1} \\
			This displays the first recipe currently shown in the recipe list.

		& \mono{view recipe pancakes} \\
		This displays the recipe named \enquote{pancakes}. Note that the name here is case insensitive.

	\end{bulletlist}

	To illustrate, in the scenario below, both \mono{\#1} and \mono{pancakes} will refer to the same recipe:
